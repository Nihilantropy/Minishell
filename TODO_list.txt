Heredoc must be redo. Follow this step:
	1) parse the string to find all the '<<' token occurence.
	2) handle them right before the executor part and make as many temp files as the redirection needed
	3) once all the necessary files are created, in the executor all is left to do is to redirect the standard input to the temp files
This method should also handle correctly the signal calls when the Heredocs are open in write mode

Implement NON-INTERACTIVE MODE. ex: "./minishell -c echo hello; ls". This calls the programm with the arguments to parse
and to execute.

We must redo the signals because they don't work in the best way

Check eventual memory leaks.

Implement strong error messages on standard error.
