Make the here_doc redirection works perfectly.

We must redo the signals because they don't work in the best way

When the pipeline chain process start, make the CTRL C signal exit the process

See the cat | cat pipeline. (in general see the pipe)

Check eventual memory leaks.

Check if we want our shell to work exactly like the bash or not. The bash shell
	can execute the pipeline not perfectly in order. The parent process doesn't necessary
	wait the exit of the child process. Check this thing if it's an evaluation issue.
	(i asked to frau and he confirmed that the shell must work like bash).

Check the perror on the unset PATH event

Check the execve path. The programs can be executed from any directory, not only the PATH
