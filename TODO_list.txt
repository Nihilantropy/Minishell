Make the here_doc redirection works perfectly.

Bultin echo: echo -n ciao > outfile. Doesn't write on the outfile, but write "ciao" on the 
	old STDOUT.
Builtin exit: exit goes into seg fault.

When the pipeline chain process start, make the CTRL C signal exit the process

See the cat | cat pipeline.

Check eventual memory leaks.

Check if we want our shell to work exactly like the bash or not. The bash shell
	can execute the pipeline not perfectly in order. The parent process doesn't necessary
	wait the exit of the child process. Check this thing if it's an evaluation issue.

 Check the perror on the unset PATH event
